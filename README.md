# EntitifyIt

A simple, quick tool to clean original code (HTML/CSS/Javascript) with character entities for code examples.
You can test it at https://creamlib.github.io/EntitifyIt/.

It uses clipboard.js (https://zenorocha.github.io/clipboard.js) for copying entitified code -- thanks @zenorocha for that!
